================================

This module provides an interface to the OpenSP SGML parser.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

PPM PACKAGE

A Win32 ppm package, suitable for use with ActivePerl compatible
Perl packages, is kindly provided by Randy Kobes at

  http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/

To install it, within the ppm shell set the repository to

  http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer58

and then

  ppm> install SGML-Parser-OpenSP

This should run a post-install script to fetch and install the
needed OpenSP 1.5.2+ DLL; if this doesn't work, the DLL can be
obtained from

  http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/scripts/

which should subsequently be placed somewhere in the PATH.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Perl 5.8.0 or later
  Class::Accesor
  The OpenSP library v1.5.2 or later, see http://openjade.sf.net/

Note that you need the header files and link libraries included in
"-dev" packages for OpenSP, not just the command line applications.
